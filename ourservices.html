					<h3>Digital Mammography</h3>
					<p>
						A mammogram is an imaging examination of the breast performed to
						detect breast cancer in its earliest stages, often before any
						signs or symptoms of the disease are present. This exam is
						recommended annually for women over the age of 40. In addition to
						age, patients who have a personal or family history of breast
						cancer, abnormal breast changes or long-term use of hormone
						therapy may also be at an increased risk of developing breast
						cancer and should be screened on a regular basis.<br>
						<br>Mammograms may be performed for screening or diagnostic
						purposes. Screenings involve producing images of both breasts in
						order to detect any tumors that cannot yet be felt under the skin.
						They can also detect calcium deposits that may indicate breast
						cancer. Diagnostic mammograms are performed after a lump or other
						sign of breast cancer has been detected, or after abnormalities
						were present during a screening mammogram. This procedure targets
						a specific area of the breast and takes more detailed images from
						many different angles.

					<h3>DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry)</h3>
					<p>DEXA (Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry) is an enhanced X-ray
						image of the skeleton that provides the most accurate measurements
						of bone density available. Bone density tests are used to
						determine whether patients have osteoporosis, a condition in which
						bones are weakened and fracture easily.</p>

					<h3>MRI / Open MRI</h3>
					<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a non-invasive,
						radiation-free scanning technology that uses radio waves and
						magnetic fields to produce clear and detailed three-dimensional
						images of nearly any organ or hard and soft tissues in the body.
						MRI can be used to identify or precisely locate an injury or
						abnormality, to scan for developing problems or analyze damage
						from previous trauma, and to aid in the planning of surgery. MRI
						produces images of any area of the body and can be an invaluable
						tool for detecting tumors, infection, cancer and damage to the eye
						and inner ear, nervous system, heart and blood vessels, joint and
						musculoskeletal systems, major organs and male and female
						reproductive systems.</p>

					<h3>Ultrasound</h3>
					<p>
						Ultrasound imaging, or sonography, produces images of the inside
						of the body using high-frequency sound waves. These images are
						captured in real-time, and are able to show the structure and
						movement of the organs.<br>
						<br>Ultrasound imaging can be used to monitor and diagnose a
						wide range of conditions within nearly any system of the body.
						This test may be performed on patients experiencing pain, swelling
						or infection in a certain area of the body. <br>
						<br>It is especially useful for examining the breasts,
						bladder, thyroid, abdominal organs and male and female
						reproductive organs, and for obtaining images of fetuses in the
						womb. In addition, ultrasound is often used as a real-time guide
						during needle biopsies for the precise sampling of tissue.

					<h3>CT</h3>
					<p>
						Computed tomography (CT), or CAT scan, uses X-rays to obtain
						images of the body. CT scans are highly useful for examining
						injuries and abnormalities, guiding needle biopsies and aiding in
						surgical preparation.<br>
						<br>The patient is positioned on a table on his or her back,
						side or stomach, and may be provided with pillows for comfortable
						support. The table moves very slowly through the doughnut-shaped
						CT scanner. The X-ray beam inside the CT unit spirals slowly
						around the patient on all sides, creating 360-degree images or
						"slices" of the area being examined. As the patient moves through
						the unit, many slices are captured. The images are then combined
						to produce a highly detailed, three-dimensional digital image.

					<h3>PET / CT</h3>
					<p>PET/CT is a new imaging tool that combines two scan
						techniques in one exam – a PET scan and a CT scan. PET/CT, like
						Nuclear Medicine procedures, requires an injection of a small
						radiopharmaceutical and is mainly used for diagnosis, staging, or
						restaging malignant disease and metastases. It can also be used to
						differentiate dementia verses Alzheimer’s disease. The two
						procedures together provide information about the location, nature
						of, and the extent of the diagnosed cancer.</p>

					<h3>X Ray</h3>
					<p>An x-ray is an imaging exam that produces images of your
						bones and other internal organs in a fast, painless manner. X-rays
						are done to determine the existence of a wide range of conditions,
						including tooth decay, arthritis, bone cancer, lung cancer, and
						problems affecting the digestive tract. While x-rays expose
						patients to radiation, the amount is too small to pose any major
						risks; nevertheless, women that are or might be pregnant should
						inform their doctors beforehand to prevent potential harm to their
						unborn child.</p>

				<div class="col-md-9 col-sm-9 pull-left viok-services-desc" id="8">
					<h3>Nuclear Medicine</h3>
					<p>
						Nuclear medicine specialists use safe, painless, and
						cost-effective techniques to image the body and treat disease. It
						provides doctors with information about both structure and
						function. Nuclear Medicine procedures often identify abnormalities
						very early in the progress of disease – long before many medical
						problems are apparent with other diagnostic tests. <br> <br>
						Nuclear medicine uses very small amounts of radioactive materials
						(radiopharmaceuticals) to diagnose and treat disease. The amount
						of radiation in a typical nuclear imaging procedure is comparable
						with that received during a diagnostic x-ray, and the amount
						received in a typical treatment procedure is kept within safe
						limits.

					<h3>Interventional Radiology</h3>
					<p>
						Interventional radiology is a medical sub-specialty of radiology
						which utilizes minimally-invasive image-guided procedures to
						diagnose and treat diseases in nearly every organ system. The
						concept behind interventional radiology is to diagnose and treat
						patients using the least invasive techniques currently available
						in order to minimize risk to the patient and improve health
						outcomes. <br> <br> Many conditions that once required
						surgery can now be treated non-surgically by interventional
						radiologists. By minimizing the physical trauma to the patient,
						peripheral interventions can reduce infection rates and recovery
						time.
